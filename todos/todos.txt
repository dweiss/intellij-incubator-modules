SET JVMARGS=--add-modules jdk.incubator.vector

--enable-preview for Lucene?

- create a project that uses "normal" preview options and jdk incubator module options. how does it compile? what does it need at runtime?
  does intellij support it out of the box?

- make the above project export a service. would that service load/be exported properly?
